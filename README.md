# furniture-store-landing-page
A responsive landing page for a furniture store that is having a special promotional sale on kids furniture.

## Run Locally

### Comments
I wanted the website to be cute and functional since the content is for kids furniture. Other than the countdown and carousel, I have added a header and a footer just to help visualize the content on an actual web page (though none of the content in the header or footer is actually interactable). In addition, I created a "SHOP NOW" call to action under the countdown that scrolls the page down to the shop. This makes the countdown more actionable. For the carousel, the current item is subtly indicated with a change in the border-style of the cards, and yellow is used to make the button and low price stand out. There are buttons on either side to move back or forward in the carousel and indicators underneath the carousel to indicate which card is selected. The movement of the carousel is animated with a css transition. Using a media query, the page's layout changes to be more suitable for smaller screen sizes (the countdown is rearranged to maintain the hierarchy I wanted and also spread to the edges of the screen, for example).

### Things I would have done with more time
Though I accomplished a lot of what I wanted to with this project, there were many things I would have kept working on, had I had the time. For the text, I kept mostly to the styles from the style guide, even though I think the default spacing is not suited for every situation. Though I don't think my page is too inaccessible, accessibility is something I can spend a lot of time on given the chance and it is something I would have liked to work more on for this project. I also had initially planned on having more functionality for the carousel (making the indicators into buttons and making the carousel loop infinitely for example).
